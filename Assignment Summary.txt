Assignment:

Goal:
- Implement two scheduling policies - Round Robin and Fair Mix - and use them to execute tasks from a sample file and then automatically calculate average response time and overhead of context switches for both scheduling policies.

Input:
- Can be specified in any order
- Will need to use getopt() function
- Simulation data will be read from file via input redirection
- 4 CLAs
-t 2 (int)
-- Time slice, specified in seconds
-i 7000 (int)
-- Starting task ids
-o 1 (int)
-- Overhead of context switches, with the first context to be included when the task runs for the first time
-f filename
-- Output file that contains all output data

Output:
- Output will be written both to CLI and into file specified by user in CLA
- CLI Output:
-- Print summary table on simulation end
-- Order table by ascending with task identifier
--- Task identifier contains tid, service time, completion time, response time, and wait time for each task
-- Prints average response time and total overhead time for both scheduling policies and determines which performs better with the current mix of jobs

Input Redirection:
- First number on each line is arrival time of task
- Second number on each line is service time of task

Assignment Specifications & Details:
- Will use linked lists with each task being represented by a struct
- Can only access struct via pointer to said struct
- Source file named "sched.c"
- Submit program as .tar.gz archive

Example User CLA:
"./sched -i 2000 -o 1 -t 2 -f output.data < in1"
